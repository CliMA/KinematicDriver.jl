Density and temerature profiles are constant and defined by the initial   condition, which is unsaturated. As the simulation progresses in time moisture is transported upwards,   supersaturation grows in the upper part of the domain   and precipitation is formed. In the second part of the simulation the vertical momentum flux is switched off,   leaving only cloud microphysics tendencies acting to change   the model state. Below figure shows an example prescribed vertical momentum as a function of time.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"using Plots\nimport Kinematic1D.K1DModel as K1D\n\nt_range = range(0, 15 * 60, length=100)\nw1 = 2.0\nt1 = 600.0\nplot(t_range / 60.0, [K1D.œÅw_helper(t, w1, t1) for t in t_range], linewidth=3, xlabel=\"t [min]\", ylabel=\"updraft momentum flux [m/s kg/m3]\")\nsavefig(\"prescribed_momentum_flux.svg\") #hide","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"#Changes-to-CliMA-defaults","page":"Home","title":"Changes to CliMA defaults","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"One of the goals of Kinematic1D.jl   is to test against PySDM   and the particle-based implementation of the kinematic model available in   PySDM-examples.
